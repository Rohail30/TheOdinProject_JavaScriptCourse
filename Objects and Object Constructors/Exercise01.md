# Book Constructor Question

Write a constructor for making **“Book”** objects.  
We will revisit this in the next project.

Your `Book` objects should have:

- the book’s **title**
- the **author**
- the number of **pages**
- whether or not you have **read** the book

---

## Requirement

Put a function into the constructor that can report the book info like so:

```js
theHobbit.info();
// "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, 295 pages, not read yet"
```
