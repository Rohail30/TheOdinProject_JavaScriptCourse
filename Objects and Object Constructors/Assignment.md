# Reading Assignment: Prototypes and `this` in JavaScript

## 1. Understanding Prototypes

- Read the article **[Understanding Prototypes and Inheritance in JavaScript (DigitalOcean)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-prototypes-and-inheritance-in-javascript)**.  
  This is a good review of prototype inheritance and constructor functions, with clear examples.

## 2. Prototypal Inheritance

- Spend some time with **[Prototypal Inheritance (JavaScript.info)](https://javascript.info/prototype-inheritance)**.  
  This article goes deeper into the prototype chain and inheritance.  
  **Important:** This article uses `__proto__`, which is not generally recommended in practice. Focus on the **concepts**, as youâ€™ll soon learn better ways to set prototypes.  
  ðŸ‘‰ _Donâ€™t skip the exercises at the endâ€”theyâ€™ll help cement your understanding._

## 3. The `this` Keyword

- Review **[JavaScript Tutorialâ€™s article on the this keyword](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-this/)**.  
  Pay attention to how `this` behaves differently depending on the context, and note the common pitfalls explained in each section.

## 4. `[[Prototype]]` vs `__proto__` vs `.prototype`

- Finally, read **[[Prototype]] vs **proto** vs .prototype in JavaScript](https://javascript.info/native-prototypes#proto-vs-prototype)** to clarify the differences among these terms.

### Notes

- Weâ€™ve been using the `this` keyword in object constructors and prototype methods. Understanding how it interacts with prototypes is crucial as you progress.
- Focus not just on reading but on **trying the examples and exercises** to fully grasp the material.
