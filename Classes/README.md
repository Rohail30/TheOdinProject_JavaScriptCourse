# JavaScript Classes Summary

## Introduction
JavaScript does not have classes in the same sense as traditional object-oriented languages like Java or Ruby.  
ES6 introduced the `class` keyword, which serves as syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.  
While it looks similar to classical classes, it still operates on prototypes behind the scenes.  
The syntax simplifies object creation and inheritance, but no new inheritance model was introduced.

## Lesson Overview
In this lesson, you will learn to:

- Explain the differences between an **object constructor** and a **class**.  
- Understand **getters** and **setters**.  
- Describe **basic class syntax**.  
- Implement **inheritance** using classes.  
- Use **private fields and methods**.  
- Work with **static properties and methods**.

## Assignment
- Read about **getters and setters** (skip “accessor descriptors” for now).  
- Review **JavaScript.info’s** primer on class syntax.  
- Explore **MDN’s documentation** on classes for deeper insights.  

Key features to explore:
- **Extending classes** (e.g., `Player` extending `Person`).  
- **Private properties** for encapsulation.  
- **Static properties and methods**, which belong to the class rather than instances.

## Practice
Refactor your **Library project** to use `class` syntax instead of constructor functions.  
Use the **Git branching workflow** to manage your changes and practice feature-based development.

## Knowledge Check
Reflect on the following questions:
1. What differences exist between object constructors and classes?  
2. What are getters and setters?  
3. How is inheritance implemented with classes?  
4. What are private class features?  
5. What are static properties?
